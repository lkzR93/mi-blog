                                <p>
                                    The story of coffee begins in Ethiopia, where legend tells of a goat herder named Kaldi who 
                                    discovered coffee after noticing that his goats became unusually energetic after eating berries 
                                    from a certain tree. Intrigued by this observation, Kaldi tried the berries himself and 
                                    experienced a similar burst of energy. He shared his discovery with local monks, who began 
                                    using the berries to stay alert during long hours of prayer. üêê

                                <p>
                                    From Ethiopia, coffee spread to Yemen in the 15th century, where it was cultivated and 
                                    traded. The port of Mocha became synonymous with coffee. By the 16th century, coffee had 
                                    reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia, Turkey, and Northern Africa. European travelers 
                                    brought back stories of this unusual dark beverage, and by the 17th century, coffee had made 
                                    its way to Europe. ‚õµ

                                        <strong>Enhanced Focus:</strong> Coffee helps maintain concentration during long coding 
                                        sessions by blocking adenosine, the compound responsible for making us feel tired.
